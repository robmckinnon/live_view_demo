# MIDI LiveView Demo

This is my entry in [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com), showing off what [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) can do.

* Connect MIDI keyboards or controllers to your computer.
* See music played on a piano roll generated via Phoenix LiveView talking to the Web MIDI API.
* Listen to notes played by the browser using the Web Audio API.

Screenshot of running app:
